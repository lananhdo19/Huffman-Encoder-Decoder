# Huffman Encoder and Decoder
#Compiles into two executables in make: ./encoder and ./decoder
#Executables take in one textfile
#Encoder takes text and prints out the prefix codes per individual character, encoded text, and information about compression cost and ratio
#Decoder only takes an encoded textfile without any prefixes or huffman tree structures and prints out decoded text
