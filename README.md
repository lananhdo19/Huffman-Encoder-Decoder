# Huffman Encoder and Decoder

### Was part of CS2150 coursework giving credit to the original author of Heap.h and Heap.cpp 

Compiles into two executables (./encoder and ./decoder) that take in one textfile

Encoder takes text and prints out the prefix codes per individual character, encoded text, and information about compression cost and ratio

Decoder only takes an encoded textfile without any prefixes or huffman tree structures and prints out decoded text
